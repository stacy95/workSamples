**Understanding the file structure **

Hello!

Here are some snippets of my code that I did. I have created separate folders to differentiate each language stack. 

Within each folder, I have folders to divide the tasks; that are notifications, registering a new user, and a page for the admin and user to talk to each other. 

Outside of the folders, I have several screenshots of what the website looks like. 

Enjoy!
